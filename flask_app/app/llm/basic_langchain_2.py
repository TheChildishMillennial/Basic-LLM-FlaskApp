        She rose to fame through her family's reality show "Keeping Up with the Kardashians" which premiered in 2007.
        <|user|>: What is Kim Kardashian famous for?
        <|model|> Kim Kardashian is best known for starring in the reality television series "Keeping Up with the 
        Kardashians," which premiered in 2007 and has since become one of the most popular shows on E! Entertainment.
        She also gained notoriety through her personal life, including her high-profile relationships and marriages to
        professional basketball player Kris Humphries and rapper Kanye West.
        
        In addition to her reality television career, Kim Kardashian has built a successful business empire that
        includes fashion lines, beauty products, and various other ventures. She is also known for her social media
        presence with millions of followers on Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok.
        
        Kim Kardashian's influence extends beyond entertainment and business into the legal field as well. In 2018,
        she successfully lobbied President Donald Trump to commute the sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, a woman serving
        life in prison for non-violent drug offenses. This led to her involvement with criminal justice reform efforts 
        and the establishment of the #Cut50 initiative.
        
        Overall, Kim Kardashian is best known for her reality television career, personal life, business ventures, and 
        her influence in the legal field through advocacy work."
